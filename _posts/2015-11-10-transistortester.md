# Gear-Best Transistor Tester

I recently received a device from the Chinese electronics retailer, [GearBest.com](http://www.gearbest.com) for review. 
The device is a [DIY Transistor Tester](http://www.gearbest.com/kits/pp_228313.html), but is more of a multi-purpose electronics testing tool. 

## Unboxing

It was shipped via DHL, and arrived without incident. It was nicely packaged, no damage etc. It did not include any instructions or documentation however. 

The main box was full of bubble wrap

Again, no packing list, no instruction sheet, no documentation, no parts list

Inside that box was a anti-static bag enclosing all of the parts for the kit.

If you're used to getting kits from [adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com) or [sparkfun](http://www.sparkfun.com), you're going to have some adjusting to do. However this kit was only 20 dollars, which is a deal for what it can do. 

## The Assembly

I have a fair amount of circuit assembly experience, so the actual assembly of the kit was not a problem for me. As you can see, the board is well labeled as far as the value and polarity of each component. Knowing how to read resistor color codes is important. I just used my multi-meter to test the resistors. Having resistors that are labeled with their values would make the kit assembly easier. The kit itself doesn't really NEED documentation IF you have experience, but for folks new to electronics and circuits this would be a serious challenge.

The only parts I found somewhat confusing where the placement of the screen, and the test socket. I had to reference the images on the product page on GearBest to find the proper pin placements for the screen and how it should attach, and how to use the test socket.

The assembly was quick and easy for me and I only had one part left over...which I've surmised is for calibration purposes. 

## The Device

This device is labeled as a Transistor tester, but can do much more than that. It tests Capacitance, Resistance, and Transistor types and voltages. It can also work as a function generator, frequency tester, and frequency generator. I have not tested these features yet. 
It is powered off of a single 9v battery, and does self-diagnostics and calibration. The brain is the common ATMEGA328p, commonly found in the Arduino development board family.

I look forward to using this device to sort my pile of misc. transistors and as a tool to help me to continue not having to remember part codes. 

## Conclusion

This Transistor Tester is a powerful tool to have access to. It can do a variety of testing and diagnostics and will save you having to look up multiple datasheets for parts. The product would be improved with an assembly guide and a short manual on how to use the different modes and functions but for an experienced hobbiest it will be a breeze. 

Thanks GearBest for the opportunity to review this product.
