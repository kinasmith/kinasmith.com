# The Kinesthete

The Kinesthete is a new electronic musical instrument that allows for musically intuitively and expressive playability and provides the tactile response and feedback of an analog instrument. The Kinesthete’s controls are not quantized, but are continuously variable inputs evocative of a cello. Discrete musical notes are defined only via physical interaction with the instrument's fretboard, which allows for a natural expressiveness that is not possible with most digital music controllers or keyboard type instruments. 

The Kinesthete generates sound via a real-time synthesis engine running on an embedded ARM processor. It is transparently integrated into the instrument. In addition to the on board processing, the Kinesthete has two 15 watt audio drivers in ported enclosures making playable free of external amps or mixers. It is capable of creating a stereo sound field and is loud enough to hold its own in a crowded space.
