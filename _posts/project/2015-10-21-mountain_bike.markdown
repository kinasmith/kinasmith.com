#Mountain Bike!

In 2013 I was working in a bike shop with two talented frame builders, [Corey Thompson](http://thompsoncustombicycles.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Bill Stevenson](http://stevensoncustombikes.com/){:target="_blank"}. They inspired me to begin learning to braze and during the winter of 2013 I built my first bike frame. The frame geometry is customized by me. The construction was done using hand files and oxy-acetelyne for brass brazing. The tubes are fillet brazed together with no lugs. Below is a selection of the photos from the construction process.
