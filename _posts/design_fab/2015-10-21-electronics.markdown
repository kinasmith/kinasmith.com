#Circuit Design and Prototyping

I've done a wide variety of electronics fabrication in my projects. It all started with the book [Handmade Electronic Music](http://www.nicolascollins.com/handmade.htm){:target="_blank"} and morphed into an interest in music synthesis and music technology, specifically analog synthesis hardware and techniques. I took inspiration from [Peter Blasser](http://www.ciat-lonbarde.net/){:target="_blank"} during these early experimental days and built a semi-modular analog synthesiser using his paper circuit fabrication techniques. 

I also have worked with high powered LED lighting for bicycles. Using a dynamo hub as a power source, and designed and built several stand alone lighting systems (headlight and taillight) and also did LED retrofits on vintage Luxor taillights so they could work with modern headlight systems. 
During my masters degree, I had access to more advanced circuit design and fabrication tools and learned how to make my own PCBs and about surface mount design and assembly.
