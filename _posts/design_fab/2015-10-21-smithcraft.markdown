#Smithcraft Designs

I operated a small business crafting earrings, belt buckles, and other accessories for a time in 2013. It was called Smithcraft Designs, and I used many scrap parts of the bike shop I was working in. Stainless steel spokes, and worn chains and other drive-train components to make the items.
